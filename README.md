# Tabs Billsplitter

#### Tabs Billsplitter is a mobile app for friends to split the check and pay each other back after eating out. Tabs uses text recognition technology and a custom algorithm to process information about a check, calculate tax and tip, and determine what everyone owes.

---

## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

Tabs bill-splitting app was built with React Native and Redux on the front end, and uses Expo to build native iOS and android apps simultaneously. We used Firebase's Realtime Database to store and update receipt information in real time. To continue using Expo, we decided to handle the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) outside of the platform and used Google Cloud Vision to fetch data from receipts. Tabs was styled with Native-Base.
